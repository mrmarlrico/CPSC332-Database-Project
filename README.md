#CPSC332: Database Project

This is the final project for my CPSC 332: File Structures and Database Systems. 

In this project we simulated on how to create our own database with the use of SQL. In addition we created a basic website using HTML and PHP in which it would pull out information from the database based on the information input by the user.
